# TicTacToe
A game of TicTacToe implemented with JS and HTML - when played with the computer, we use the Minimax algorithm. The ultimate goal is to have a 2 player setup where 2 players could connect over the internet and play with each other. This will be achieved by using NodeJS, and Socket IO for 2-way communication.
